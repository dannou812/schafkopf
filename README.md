# schafkopf

This is intended to be a playground for algorithms and eventually a neural network in the realm of the german game "Schafkopf".

# Gameplay/UI

There are two planned ways to play/run this game:

## Player Mode

One player can play against 3 bots using different algorithms.

## Bot Mode

A tournament-like approach, where different algorithms/bots can play against each other. After a configurable amount of games a ranking will be created. This is also the main use-case of the game.
